\section{Conclusion}
In this literature review, sentence-level Nepali to English neural machine translation with and without attention mechanism was studied. The experiments were carried out on the collection of two datasets - English-Nepali Parallel Corpus from the Nepali National Corpus and tico-19 v2020-10-28 from the Translation Initiative for COVID-19. Out of 3981 pairs of sentences, 3000 pairs were used for training, and the remaining 981 pairs for testing. The performance of the systems was evaluated using the BLEU score.
\\\\
From the observations, it can be concluded that the neural machine translation system works much better when the attention mechanism was included.

\section{Future Recommendation}
As of now, this neural machine translation system has become obsolete. So, this study can be carried out using the Transformer mechanism.
